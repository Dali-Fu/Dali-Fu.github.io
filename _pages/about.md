I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Nanjing University (NJU), and my tutor is Professor Sun Ninghua.

<!-- I received my PhD from xx in xx.-->

Prior to that, I received a master's degree in statistics with a concentration in statistical machine learning. I also worked as a quantitative trader for a few months, and I benefited greatly from that job.

Currently, my research interest is Macroeconomic Theory. I am focusing on CBDC, public debt and banking, and my thesis is willing to talk about the macroeconomic effects of Chinese government debt, especially its transmission mechanism via the financial system. In addition, I have payed a considerable amounts of energy to Marxist political economy and its application in China
